## WeatherDashboard

Use this weather dashboard to check for current weather and the 5-day forecast.

This application leverages the OpenWeatherMap API to query weather data.

I first get the coordinates of the city that is queried in the application, and then look up the lat and lon coordinates to get the weather.
